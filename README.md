Designed to connect ideas to creators.

### Big Idea

It is probable that intelligent people around the world organically think of great ideas on a daily basis. However, many of these ideas fizzle out because of a lack of commitment, expertise, motivation, or support. On the other side of the coin, there are many intelligent people with specific skillsets who are willing to work for a product, service, or cause that they are passionate about, whether that be full time, part time, or just as a weekend hobby. Spark works to connect one person's ingenuity with another's execution.

### Installation

Spark is currently in development. Once we have our minimum viable product, we will be sure to include installation instructions here.

### Usage

#### Spark (noun)

\ ˈspärk  \

The essence of an inspiration or idea, sourced directly from the thinker. Often presented in the form of a short description, a question or sentence. More developed Sparks can be viewed as websites, applications, demo videos, pitches, etc. Users will be able to view Sparks that interest them, as well as share their own.
